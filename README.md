### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brandon. I am a React and JavaScript enthusiast who is in the beginning of a long journey towards mastery. Currently, I am building a portfolio and personal website to learn and demonstrate the components from React. I have so many ideas that I would love to learn, build, and deploy. It will be great to collaborate in a team at some point, but for now it's me and the books (*books as in YouTube, Github, Discord, Leetcode, and Reddit) ! 

Hope you have a great day!

*Check out my DevCard below for what I am learning*
